# Security Considerations

Security is a critical aspect of any protocol that enables tool access and execution. This section outlines key security considerations when implementing and using UTCP.

## Authentication

UTCP supports several authentication methods across different communication protocol types:

### API Key Authentication

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "auth_type": "api_key",
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "var_name": "X-API-Key",
    "location": "header"
  }
}
```

The `location` field specifies where the API key is placed, and can be `header`, `query`, or `cookie`.

### Basic Authentication

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "auth_type": "basic",
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass"
  }
}
```

### OAuth2 Authentication

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "auth_type": "oauth2",
    "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "token_url": "https://auth.example.com/token",
    "scope": "read:tools"
  }
}
```

The `scope` field is optional and specifies the level of access that the client is requesting.

## Tool Access Control

When exposing tools through UTCP, consider implementing these access controls:

1. **Tool-Level Permissions**: Define which users/agents can access specific tools
2. **Parameter Constraints**: Restrict parameter values to prevent abuse
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user/per-tool rate limits
4. **Usage Quotas**: Set maximum usage quotas for tools
5. **Audit Logging**: Log all tool calls for security monitoring

## Communication Protocol-Specific Considerations

### HTTP

- Always use HTTPS, never HTTP

### CLI

:::important

CLI poses a significant security risk as it executes commands on the local system.
:::

- Validate and sanitize all input parameters
- Run commands with the minimum necessary permissions
- Implement allow-lists for permitted commands
- Sandbox execution environments when possible

### WebSocket

- Use secure WebSocket (WSS) connections

## Data Protection

1. **Data in Transit**: Ensure all communications use TLS 1.2+ encryption
2. **Data at Rest**: Encrypt sensitive configuration data
3. **Sensitive Data in Logs**: Prevent logging of sensitive parameters
4. **PII Handling**: Implement proper controls for personal information

## Secure Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Use HTTPS/WSS for all network communications
- [ ] Implement proper authentication for all communication protocols
- [ ] Validate all input against schemas before processing
- [ ] Sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks
- [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Set appropriate timeouts for all operations
- [ ] Log security-relevant events
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies
- [ ] Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

## Common Vulnerabilities to Avoid

| Vulnerability | Prevention |
|--------------|------------|
| Injection Attacks | Validate and sanitize all inputs |
| Credential Leakage | Use secure credential storage |
| Excessive Permissions | Follow the principle of least privilege |
| Man-in-the-Middle | Use certificate validation and pinning |
| Denial of Service | Implement rate limiting and timeouts |
| Information Disclosure | Ensure errors don't leak sensitive data |

## Secure Development Lifecycle

1. **Design**: Conduct threat modeling during protocol design
2. **Implementation**: Follow secure coding practices
3. **Testing**: Perform security testing and code reviews
4. **Deployment**: Use secure deployment practices
5. **Maintenance**: Monitor for security issues and update regularly

By following these security considerations, UTCP implementations can minimize risks while enabling powerful tool integrations across various communication protocols.
