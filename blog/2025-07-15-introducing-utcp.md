# Introducing UTCP: The Direct Alternative to MCP

We're excited to introduce the **Universal Tool Calling Protocol (UTCP)** ‚Äî a modern, flexible, and scalable standard for defining and interacting with tools across a wide variety of communication protocols.

<!--truncate-->

## Why UTCP?

While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has made strides in standardizing AI-tool interactions, it comes with inherent limitations that UTCP addresses head-on:

### üöÄ **Zero Latency Overhead**
Unlike MCP's proxy-based architecture, UTCP enables direct tool calls without intermediary layers. Your AI agents communicate directly with tools, eliminating unnecessary latency.

### üîí **Enhanced Security**
UTCP's design principles prioritize security from the ground up. With direct protocol support and built-in authentication mechanisms, you get enterprise-grade security without compromising performance.

### üåê **Protocol Flexibility**
While MCP is limited to specific transport mechanisms, UTCP works seamlessly across:
- HTTP/HTTPS
- GraphQL
- gRPC
- WebSockets
- CLI interfaces
- Custom protocols

## Key Features

### Direct Tool Integration
```typescript
// Example: Direct HTTP tool call with UTCP
const weatherTool = {
  name: "get_weather",
  description: "Get current weather for a location",
  provider: {
    type: "http",
    endpoint: "https://api.weather.com/v1/current",
    method: "GET"
  },
  parameters: {
    location: { type: "string", description: "City name" }
  }
}
```

### Universal Protocol Support
UTCP isn't bound to a single communication method. Whether your tool speaks HTTP, GraphQL, or even CLI commands, UTCP can handle it:

```yaml
# GraphQL Tool Definition
name: user_search
provider:
  type: graphql
  endpoint: https://api.example.com/graphql
  query: |
    query GetUser($id: ID!) {
      user(id: $id) { name email }
    }
```

### Built-in Authentication
Security is paramount. UTCP supports multiple authentication methods out of the box:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "type": "bearer",
    "token": "${API_KEY}"
  }
}
```

## Getting Started

Ready to try UTCP? Here's how you can get started:

1. **Explore the Documentation**: Check out our comprehensive [documentation](/docs) to understand UTCP's capabilities
2. **Browse the Registry**: Visit our [tool registry](/registry) to see available UTCP-compatible tools
3. **Join the Community**: Connect with other developers on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZpMbQ8jRbD)

## The Road Ahead

UTCP is more than just a protocol ‚Äî it's a vision for the future of AI-tool interactions. We're building:

- **Expanded Protocol Support**: More communication protocols and standards
- **Enhanced Tooling**: Better development tools and SDKs
- **Community Growth**: A thriving ecosystem of tools and integrations

## Community and Contributions
